M2FSreduce
=========

Reduction software for Magellan M2FS spectra

Forked from Dan Gifford's OSMOSreduce package used to reduce 2.4m MDM telescope slit-mask spectra.

Adaptions done by Anthony Kremin for M2FS on the 6.5 Magellan-Clay telescope. Documentation for using the pipeline is available as an IPython notebook in the docs/ subdirectory.
