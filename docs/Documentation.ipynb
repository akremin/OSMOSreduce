The cyan line and orange circle show the initial guess of what peak corresponds to that reference line based on the step before.

The first is that it is time consuming. We tested this program on multi-slit observations of galaxy clusters which had ~25-30 slits/mask. Using some fraction of carefully spaced reference lines saves a lot of time. In addition, depending on the arc exposure time, some of the lines can be hard to see and match.
